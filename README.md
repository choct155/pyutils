# Generic Utilities for Python
> This is a convenience project to house generic functionality across projects. It also serves as a test case for the <a href='https://nbdev.fast.ai/'>nbdev</a> workflow on an actual project.


*Note that you must use a pre-v6.0 version of `nbconvert` with `nbdev`. Even if it says the version number is pre-v6 in a `conda list` call, you may have to explicitly install the right version (`conda install nbconvert==5.6.1`).*
